    "text": "Introduction\nI chose ten novels from three different period of ~100 years. I started with Gothic literature from the late 1700’s to 1899. I then chose ten works ranging from the late 1600s right up to 1799ish (carefully not choosing duplicates). Then I used ten works from 1480-1750, trying to mostly focus on before 1700. I used the Norton World and English Literature sets to pick out my sources. The limitations I see with this dataset is of course that I can’t use every piece of literature. Hence, I stuck with the most influential and well known works.\nMy motivation for this project came from playing around with Voyant and discovering that the word “time” was used a lot of times in Gothic literature from 1890-1899. So, I decided to set out and explore this deeper. The questions I asked were is this a theme that became popular during the Vicotrian period as a whole, or just the final decade? How does the Victorian usage of the word “time” compare to 18th century usage? And finally, was time a concept in peoples’ minds pre-industrialization?\n\n# Data Information:\n\n\nimport requests\n\n# Define the URL of the \"Dracula\" text file on Project Gutenberg\ndracula_url = 'https://www.gutenberg.org/files/345/345-0.txt'\n\n# Download the text file\nresponse = requests.get(dracula_url)\n\n# Save the text file to disk\nwith open('dracula.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    f.write(response.text)\n    \n# Define the URL of the \"Robinson Crusoe\" text file on Project Gutenberg\nrobinson_crusoe_url = 'https://www.gutenberg.org/files/521/521-0.txt'\n\n# Download the text file\nresponse = requests.get(robinson_crusoe_url)\n\n# Save the text file to disk\nwith open('robinson_crusoe.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    f.write(response.text)\n\n# Define the URL of the \"Lucasta\" text file on Project Gutenberg\nlucasta_url = 'https://www.gutenberg.org/files/703/703-0.txt'\n\n# Download the text file\nresponse = requests.get(lucasta_url)\n\n# Save the text file to disk\nwith open('lucasta.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    f.write(response.text)\n\n\n# Define the filenames of the downloaded novels\nfilenames = ['dracula.txt', 'robinson_crusoe.txt', 'lucasta.txt']\n\n# Loop over each filename and count the number of times \"time\" appears in the text\nfor filename in filenames:\n    with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        text = f.read()\n        count = text.count('time')\n        print(f'The word \"time\" appears {count} times in {filename}.')\n\nThe word \"time\" appears 475 times in dracula.txt.\nThe word \"time\" appears 381 times in robinson_crusoe.txt.\nThe word \"time\" appears 0 times in lucasta.txt.\n\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Define the filenames of the downloaded novels\nfilenames = ['dracula.txt', 'robinson_crusoe.txt', 'lucasta.txt']\n\n# Loop over each filename and count the number of times \"time\" appears in the text\ncounts = []\nfor filename in filenames:\n    with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        text = f.read()\n        count = text.count('time')\n        counts.append(count)\n\n# Create a histogram of the word frequency counts\nplt.bar(filenames, counts)\nplt.xlabel('Novel')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency of the word \"time\"')\nplt.title('Frequency of the word \"time\" in three novels')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n# Define the filenames of the downloaded novels\nfilenames = ['dracula.txt', 'robinson_crusoe.txt', 'lucasta.txt']\n\n# Loop over each filename and count the number of times \"knowledge\" appears in the text\nfor filename in filenames:\n    with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        text = f.read()\n        count = text.count('knowledge')\n        print(f'The word \"knowledge\" appears {count} times in {filename}.')\n\nThe word \"knowledge\" appears 45 times in dracula.txt.\nThe word \"knowledge\" appears 39 times in robinson_crusoe.txt.\nThe word \"knowledge\" appears 0 times in lucasta.txt.\n\n\n\n\n# Define the filenames of the downloaded novels\nfilenames = ['dracula.txt', 'robinson_crusoe.txt', 'lucasta.txt']\n\n# Loop over each filename and count the number of times \"time\" and \"knowledge\" appear in the text\ntime_counts = []\nknowledge_counts = []\nfor filename in filenames:\n    with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        text = f.read()\n        time_count = text.count('time')\n        knowledge_count = text.count('knowledge')\n        time_counts.append(time_count)\n        knowledge_counts.append(knowledge_count)\n\n# Create a comparison histogram of the word frequency counts\nwidth = 0.4\nplt.bar([i -

It shows that in a novel from the \npristine period of England, the word time was not used at all as in Lucasta, in Robinson Crusoe, \nthe word time was used a good amount, which makes sense given the novels plot, and Dracula has \nthe most usage. \n\n\n# Beginnings of your analysis\n\n\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n\n# Load the Dracula text\nwith open('dracula.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    dracula_text = f.read()\n\n# Tokenize the word \"time\" in the Dracula text\ndracula_time_tokens = word_tokenize(dracula_text)\ndracula_time_tokens = [t.lower() for t in dracula_time_tokens if t.lower() == 'time']\n\n# Load the Robinson Crusoe text\nwith open('robinson_crusoe.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    robinson_crusoe_text = f.read()\n\n# Tokenize the word \"time\" in the Robinson Crusoe text\nrobinson_crusoe_time_tokens = word_tokenize(robinson_crusoe_text)\nrobinson_crusoe_time_tokens = [t.lower() for t in robinson_crusoe_time_tokens if t.lower() == 'time']\n\n# Load the Lucasta text\nwith open('lucasta.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    lucasta_text = f.read()\n\n# Tokenize the word \"time\" in the Lucasta text\nlucasta_time_tokens = word_tokenize(lucasta_text)\nlucasta_time_tokens = [t.lower() for t in lucasta_time_tokens if t.lower() == 'time']\n\n# Print the results\nprint('Occurrences of the word \"time\" in Dracula:', len(dracula_time_tokens))\nprint('Occurrences of the word \"time\" in Robinson Crusoe:', len(robinson_crusoe_time_tokens))\nprint('Occurrences of the word \"time\" in Lucasta:', len(lucasta_time_tokens))\n\nOccurrences of the word \"time\" in Dracula: 377\nOccurrences of the word \"time\" in Robinson Crusoe: 277\nOccurrences of the word \"time\" in Lucasta: 0\n\n\n\n\nPlans\nBeginning with tokenizing, I hope to isolate the word “time” from any other word it might be connected to to find its true number of usage within my dataset. Meaning, seperating the word “time” from words like “sometime”, “next time”, etc. I thought tokenizing the word “time” using NLTK would be a good starting point for this analysis.\n\n\nFuture Visualizations\nFor the next four visualizations I plan on creating, I will be making (hopefully) network maps linking the word “time” to where it has been used in the novels. Though, I realize this might be out of scope for the amount of time I have. Secondly, a more complex bar chart comparing all 30 novels I plan on using. Thirdly, I want to make a line graph to show the increase in usage of the word “time” throughout my chosen centuries. Fourth, I want to create possible a heat graph to show where the word “time” was used most in the works I pulled."
